    "The collegeboard quiz multiple choice I took was far more easier than the other one we took earlier. It more felt like I was not anymore fatigued while going through the quiz and doing the questions. I was able to easily eliminate the wrong answers while keeping the right one in the game. On this MC I scored a 65/67 cmpared to the first MC we took during first trimester. I slightly improved from the other quiz and I wan't to further eliminate any silly mistakes that I have done.\n",

A is right because in line 5, the variable count should increase by 1 when currentNum is a perfect number, so it should only be incremented in the body of the IF statement.\n",

B is right because for this code segment, count is increased to 1 the first time “maple” is encountered in the list. However, count is reset to 0 when the code segment moves to the next list element. This causes the procedure to return 0 instead of the intended result 1.\n",
